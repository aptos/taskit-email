# Email Templates for TaskIT

## Instructions for Translators

English versions of each template are found in the 'en' folder. These are the 'originals' for reference and should not be edited. Each additional language has copies within the language folder. Those are the files that should be edited. Here's the current list of languages:

* Japanese: 'ja'

### Steps to Edit Templates

We are going to use the editor built in to github for our purposes. This is an online editor that allows us to instantly share updates. There is no software to download.

* Navigate to the file which you would like to edit by clicking the language folder, then the filename.
* Select 'Edit' from the tab menu displayed at the top of the file. The file should change to white text on a black background.
* You can now begin editing the file. It is ok to edit any text that is not part of the HTML or template markup. For example, template markup looks like this:

````erb
  <h2>Welcome to <%= site_name %>!</h2>
````

  In this case, only 'Welcome to' should be changed. However, if you would like to change the order of this greeting by placing the site_name before the welcome phrase, you may do that.

* Once your edits are complete, click the green "Commit changes" button near the bottom of the file.
* When you commit changes, you are welcome to add a comment below in the 'Commit changes' area, where some example text is shown.
